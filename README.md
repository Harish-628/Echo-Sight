**Echo-Sight** is a high-performance command center that fuses **Real-Time Computer Vision** with **Acoustic Anomaly Detection**. Designed for tactical environments, it provides a comprehensive 360° overview by correlating visual evidence with acoustic signatures.

## 🧠 Tiered Intelligence Architecture

Our architecture is segmented into specialized engines that work in parallel to ensure low-latency response:

1.  **Vision Engine (YOLOv8)**: Handles high-speed object tracking, biometric ID persistence, and sensor sabotage detection (blur/blackout).
2.  **Audio Engine (YAMNet)**: Processes environmental acoustic streams to classify 521+ audio events, focusing on critical signatures like glass breaking or shouting.
3.  **Threat Engine (Logic Fusion)**: Acts as the "Cognitive Core," fusing data from vision and audio layers to calculate a consolidated threat level.

## 🛡️ Late-Fusion Logic

Echo-Sight utilizes **Late-Fusion Logic** to significantly reduce false positives. Instead of triggering on a single sensor alert, the system correlates probabilities:
- **Decision Matrix**: A `Vision Anomaly (0.6)` paired with an `Audio Anomaly (0.4)` aggregates to a high-confidence alert.
- **Example**: If a camera experiences a "Blackout" while the Audio Engine detects "Screaming," the system immediately escalates to **CRITICAL**, triggers the AI Voice Alert, and locks down the forensic evidence.

---

## 🚀 Core Features

- **Behavioral Analytics**: Automated Loitering Detection with unique ID persistence.
- **Tamper Protection**: Real-time detection of lens blurring, repositioning, or covering.
- **📢 AI Voice Synergy**: Integrated Speech Synthesis for verbal tactical warnings.
- **Forensic Logging**: Automated high-resolution evidence capture and multi-modal reporting.

## 🛰️ Technical Stack

-   **Backend**: FastAPI, Uvicorn, Pydantic (Version-Locked)
-   **Computer Vision**: Ultralytics YOLOv8, OpenCV
-   **Deep Learning (Audio)**: TensorFlow Hub, YAMNet, Librosa
-   **Security**: Asynchronous file I/O via `aiofiles`
-   **Frontend**: Tactical Neural UI (HTML5/CSS3/JS)
